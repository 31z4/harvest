## Contributing code

Let us know if you are interested in working on an issue by leaving a comment on the issue in GitHub. This helps avoid multiple people unknowingly working on the same issue.

* Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails without your patch.
* All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.
